# Hello World!

This "Hello World" example is meant to be as simple as possible, to show the bare bones of using ebitenui.
Read through the code and comments in [main.go](main.go) to see how things are wired together.

To run this demo, use `go run main.go`. You should see a black screen, with the text "Hello World!" in white.
